  story: "Named for the naval officer and War of 1812 hero who battled the British enemy on Lake Erie, our Commodore Perry India Pale Ale has a pretty dry sense of humor. He likes to answer your question with another question. He loves trivia but refuses to participate on your pub quiz team. He would watch reality TV just to make fun of it, but he doesn�Õt own a TV. He�Õs definitely a cat person. But underneath this edgy exterior, there�Õs a sweeter side. If you�Õre bold enough to drink him, you�Õll instantly earn his respect. And when you�Õre dealing with the Commodore, respect means a lot.",
